# gFwens
A small GarrysMod C++ module that allows you to query whether or not a person is part of a Steam Group

## Footnotes
- When compiling, ensure you have a copy of the Steamworks API that is equivalent or below the version GarrysMod is currently using, otherwise you may have issues piggybacking the Steam connection.
